 * Pass the returned token to /api/council/reasoning?...&pass=<pass> and reads are
 * free until it expires (default 10 min). This is the bundled-access tier on top
 * of the per-read payment; it is deliberately NOT a recurring subscription —
 * per-request x402 and real recurring billing are separate payment products.
 * Unpaid → PAYMENT-REQUIRED 402.
