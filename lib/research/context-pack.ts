/**
 * MarketContextPack — everything needed to decide whether a claim is resolvable,
 * captured at the moment it was proposed.
 *
 * Two ideas drive the shape:
 *
 *  1. **A market is only as good as its resolution rule.** Most "the oracle got it
 *     wrong" disputes are really "the rule was ambiguous". So the pack forces the
 *     ambiguities out into named fields — threshold, units, rounding, timezone,
 *     geographic scope, void rule — instead of leaving them implied by prose.
 *
 *  2. **Only a hash goes on chain.** Storing the pack itself would be enormous and
 *     immutable-by-accident. `contextPackHash()` is a deterministic digest over
 *     canonically-ordered fields, so anyone holding the pack can prove it is the
 *     one the market committed to, while the pack stays editable off chain through
 *     explicit, audited versions.
 *
 * A source that later disappears is why `contentHash` and `excerpt` are captured
 * per source: the market can still be settled against what was actually read.
