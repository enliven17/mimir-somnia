/**
 * Prompt-injection defense for the settlement agents.

 * Claim fields (question, positions, settlement rule, resolution URL …) come
 * straight from permissionless on-chain `createClaim` calldata, and web
 * evidence comes from an attacker-chosen URL. All of it is UNTRUSTED DATA that
 * must never be able to steer an LLM whose output moves real USDC.
 *
 * Two layers:
 *  1. `fenceUntrusted` wraps content in a delimited block and strips any
 *     attempt to forge/close that delimiter, so content can't break out.
 *  2. `INJECTION_GUARD` is a standing instruction that everything inside those
 *     blocks is data, never commands.
 *
 * ponytail: this is mitigation, not a guarantee. Decisive settlement should
 * still prefer structured, provider-verified data over free-text reasoning.
