/**
 * Per-track and combined council consensus (§04).
 *
 * Two juries now vote on the same claim: the classic personas and the philosopher
 * track. Their tallies must be reported separately AND together, because the whole
 * reason for a second track is to see when the two frames disagree — and a single
 * merged number is exactly what hides that.
 *
 * The combined tally weights the two tracks EQUALLY rather than counting heads.
 * Otherwise adding a philosopher moves the combined verdict simply by making that
 * track larger, which would let jury size decide outcomes instead of jury
 * reasoning. Ten philosophers and two classic personas is still one vote each way.
 *
 * Abstentions are counted, never dropped: a claim where most of the jury declined
 * to call it is a different result from one where the jury split, and averaging
 * only the confident voters would report them identically.
